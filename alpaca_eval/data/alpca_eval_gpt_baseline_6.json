        "output": "Uploading a bibliography database to Overleaf can help streamline the process of managing citations in your LaTeX documents. Here's a simple guide to upload a `.bib` file to Overleaf:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Bibliography File\nEnsure you have a `.bib` file prepared with all your bibliographic entries. This file is usually created using a reference manager or by hand in a plain text editor. Each entry should be in the BibTeX format.\n\n### Step 2: Log in to Overleaf\nGo to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and log in to your account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to sign up first.\n\n### Step 3: Open Your Project\nOnce logged in, either create a new project or open an existing project where you want to add your bibliography.\n\n### Step 4: Upload Your `.bib` File\n- In the Overleaf editor, look for the project sidebar on the left side of the screen.\n- At the top of the sidebar, there is an \"Upload\" link (usually represented by an upward-facing arrow icon).\n- Click on the \"Upload\" link, and a dialog box will appear.\n- You can either drag and drop your `.bib` file into the designated area or click on the \"Select a file from your computer\" button to navigate to your file's location and select it.\n\n### Step 5: Add Your Bibliography to Your Document\nAfter the upload is complete, your `.bib` file will appear in the project's file list. To use this bibliography database in your document, you need to reference it within your LaTeX file. This is typically done by adding the following line to your LaTeX document where you want the bibliography to appear:\n\n```latex\n\\bibliography{yourbibfilename}\n```\n\nReplace `yourbibfilename` with the actual name of your `.bib` file, without the `.bib` extension.\n\n### Step 6: Use Citations in Your Document\nWithin your document, you can now cite entries from your bibliography database using the `\\cite{}` command. For example:\n\n```latex\n\\cite{Smith2023}\n```\n\nMake sure the citation keys match those in your `.bib` file.\n\n### Step 7: Compile the Document\nAfter adding references to your document, you need to compile it to see the bibliography and citations appear. Overleaf automatically uses BibTeX or Biber (depending on the settings and requirements of the document class or bibliography package you're using) to process your bibliography.\n\n### Step 8: Review Your Document\nAfter compilation, review your document to ensure that citations and the bibliography appear as expected. If there are any issues, check for typos in your `.bib` file and in the citation keys used in your LaTeX document.\n\n### Step 9: Download or Share Your Project\nOnce you're satisfied with the document, you can download it in your preferred format or share it directly from Overleaf with collaborators.\n\nRemember to use the appropriate bibliography and citation packages in your LaTeX preamble, such as `\\usepackage{natbib}`, `\\usepackage{biblatex}`, or another suitable package, to ensure proper formatting and functionality of your references.",

A giggle at a funeral is typically seen as inappropriate, as funerals are generally solemn occasions. This line suggests that she does not conform to societal expectations and finds humor where others might only see sadness or seriousness.\n\n3. \"Knows everybody's disapproval\" indicates that she is aware of others' judgment or criticism of her behavior or their relationship, yet she remains undeterred or unaffected by it. This could imply that their love is unconventional or not widely accepted by those around them.\n\n4. \"I should've worshipped her sooner\" implies that the singer regrets not appreciating her unique qualities earlier in their relationship. The use of \"worshipped\" is a strong word that elevates her status to almost a divine level, suggesting that he holds immense love and respect for her.\n\nOverall, the lyrics reflect a sense of devotion and admiration for someone who is unapologetically themselves, even in the face of societal disapproval. The metaphors used portray a relationship that is deeply personal and possibly countercultural, with a strong emotional connection that the singer holds in high regard.",

        "instruction": "You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.\n\nI'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",
        "output": "Traveling with someone who isn’t enjoying the experience can be challenging, especially when you're confined to close quarters like a car or shared accommodation. When addressing the issue, it's crucial to maintain respect and empathy to ensure an amicable split. Here’s how you could approach the situation:\n\n1. **Find the Right Moment**: Choose a calm moment to bring up the subject, preferably at a time when he is not wearing his AirPods and seems more approachable.\n\n2. **Express Your Feelings**: Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel. For example, \"I feel a bit isolated when we're not talking during the drive,\" rather than \"You're making this trip miserable.\"\n\n3. **Ask for His Perspective**: Invite him to share his thoughts and feelings. There might be something on his mind that’s affecting his mood. Say something like, “I've noticed you seem a bit distant. Is everything okay? I'm here if you want to talk about it.”\n\n4. **Offer a Solution**: Present your plan to travel separately in a way that focuses on your needs rather than his behavior. For instance: \"I've been thinking, I feel I need some alone time to recharge. I'm considering continuing the trip solo once we get to Wellington. I think it might be a good opportunity for both of us to enjoy the trip in our own ways.\"\n\n5. **Stay Calm and Respectful**: If he reacts negatively, stay calm and do not escalate the situation. Remember, your goal is to part ways amicably. “I’m sorry if this wasn’t what you were expecting. I value our friendship and I think this might be the best way for us both to enjoy our time in New Zealand.”\n\n6. **Discuss Practicalities**: If he's open to the idea, discuss the practical aspects of splitting up – like the division of costs, any shared belongings, and how you’ll handle transportation and accommodation moving forward.\n\n7. **Leave the Door Open**: Assure him that this doesn't mean the end of your friendship. You can say something like, \"I think this is just what I need right now. Let's keep in touch and share our adventures. Maybe we can meet up for a meal in Christchurch or somewhere else before we leave.\"\n\n8. **Be Prepared for Any Outcome**: Be ready for the possibility that he may not take this well. If things turn sour despite your best efforts, try to remain calm and focused on the fact that you're doing what's best for you.\n\nIt's important to prioritize your enjoyment and mental health during your travels. While it’s unfortunate that this situation has arisen, taking action to ensure that you can both enjoy your trip separately may be the most considerate and fair solution for both parties.",

The missing pieces must be filled in with imaginative but logical information.\n\nTen European football teams – the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales – will participate in a season-long “OneLove” campaign promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination.",
        "output": "Title: United in Victory: The OneLove Champions\n\nIn the heart of Europe, where the passion for football knows no bounds, an inspiring campaign began to take root. The \"OneLove\" initiative, a beacon of hope and unity, aimed to transcend the beautiful game itself, fostering a spirit of inclusion and a firm stand against discrimination in all its forms.\n\nThe campaign was set to unfold over an exhilarating season, with ten of Europe's proudest football teams—each with a storied history and a passionate following—pledging their commitment to the cause. The Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales; each nation was not just playing for goals and glory, but also for a much greater goal: a message of equality and respect both on and off the pitch.\n\nAs the season commenced, the OneLove emblem—a heart encased in the colors of the rainbow, symbolizing diversity and acceptance—graced the jerseys of every player. It wasn't just a patch on their kits; it became a badge of honor and a reminder of the values they were representing.\n\nThe stadiums, usually fierce battlegrounds, transformed into arenas of camaraderie, where fans from different cultures and backgrounds came together, united by their love for the game and the campaign's powerful message. Chants and cheers in various languages filled the air, but they all shared a common thread—support for inclusion.\n\nEach match was preceded by players from opposing teams standing together in a moment of solidarity, holding up a banner that read \"Unity in Diversity.\" The gesture was simple yet profound, capturing the attention of millions and setting the stage for a season that was about more than just football.\n\nAs the teams traveled across Europe, they engaged with local communities, participating in workshops and events that promoted the OneLove message. Football clinics for children emphasized fair play and respect, while forums with fans focused on eradicating racism and homophobia from the stands.\n\nOn the field, the campaign inspired beautiful displays of sportsmanship. Rivals helped each other up after a tough tackle and exchanged jerseys with genuine respect after the final whistle. The season's highlights weren't just the spectacular goals or the nail-biting matches, but the moments when players stood up against discrimination, calling out injustices and supporting one another regardless of nationality or background.\n\nThe climax of the campaign arrived with the final match of the season. It wasn't just a battle for the championship but also a culmination of the OneLove vision. The two finalists, having outplayed their rivals on the field, now stood side by side, exemplifying the campaign's success. As the referee's whistle signaled the end of the match, it wasn't just the victors who celebrated. Everyone in the stadium, from the fans to the players and staff, knew they had been part of something much bigger than the game.\n\nThe OneLove campaign had achieved its goal, not by eradicating all discrimination—that was a challenge for the long term—but by sowing seeds of change that would grow with each season. As the teams returned to their respective countries, they carried with them the message of the campaign, a commitment to continue the fight for inclusion and equality in football and beyond.\n\nAnd so, the season-long campaign might have ended, but the story of OneLove was just beginning. Across Europe, the participating teams had set into motion a powerful legacy—a reminder that when united by love and respect, the beautiful game could indeed help to change the world.",

        "output": "Here are some synonyms for the word \"adversity\" along with explanations of how they differ from the original term:\n\n1. Misfortune\n- Misfortune is a general term for bad luck or an unfortunate event. It can be used in a broad range of contexts, from minor setbacks to significant hardships. While \"adversity\" often implies a challenging situation that tests one's character or resilience, \"misfortune\" does not necessarily imply a challenge to overcome; it can simply be an unlucky occurrence.\n\n2. Hardship\n- Hardship is a synonym that is quite close in meaning to adversity. It refers to severe suffering or deprivation. Both terms suggest difficult circumstances that require endurance. However, \"hardship\" often emphasizes material or economic suffering, such as financial hardship, whereas \"adversity\" can refer to any kind of difficulty, including emotional or spiritual challenges.\n\n3. Tribulation\n- Tribulation is a term that carries a slightly more dramatic or serious connotation than \"adversity.\" It is often used in religious or formal contexts to describe a trial or distress. While \"adversity\" can apply to everyday struggles, \"tribulation\" suggests a more intense or prolonged period of suffering.\n\n4. Calamity\n- Calamity refers to a disastrous event causing great and often sudden damage or distress. It implies a more catastrophic level of impact compared to \"adversity.\" While adversity can be something that one faces and potentially overcomes, a calamity is typically a disastrous event that has severe consequences.\n\n5. Setback\n- Setback is a term that indicates a reversal or defeat in progress. It's often used in a less severe context than \"adversity.\" A setback might be a temporary obstacle or delay in achieving a goal, whereas adversity might entail a more significant or ongoing struggle.\n\n6. Affliction\n- Affliction suggests a state of pain, distress, or grief. It is often used to describe a persistent condition of suffering, sometimes due to illness. While \"adversity\" is a broad term that can include various types of challenges, \"affliction\" is more commonly associated with physical or mental suffering.\n\n7. Trial\n- Trial implies a test of endurance or patience. It can be used interchangeably with \"adversity\" in many contexts, but it may also suggest a more purposeful challenge or a situation designed to test character or ability, as in a trial by fire.\n\nEach synonym carries its own nuance and connotation, making it more suitable for different contexts or intensities of the original word \"adversity.\" When choosing a synonym, it's essential to consider the specific situation and the emotional or situational impact you wish to convey.",

        "output": "The word \"oblique\" has its origins in the Latin language. It comes from the Latin word \"obliquus,\" which means \"slanting, sidelong, indirect,\" or from \"obliqua,\" which refers to \"a slanting line or direction.\" The Latin term itself is derived from \"ob-\" meaning \"against, in the way of\" and \"liquus\" meaning \"aslant, sideways, or slanting.\"\n\nThe first known use of \"oblique\" in English dates back to the 15th century, where it was used to describe angles, lines, and muscles that were neither horizontal nor vertical, but at an angle. Since then, the word has taken on several meanings in various contexts:\n\n1. Geometry: In geometry, an oblique line is one that is not perpendicular or parallel to a given line or surface. An oblique angle is one that is not a right angle.\n\n2. Grammar: In the context of grammar, \"oblique\" can refer to oblique cases, which are noun cases other than the nominative or vocative, typically used to indicate the object of a verb or a preposition.\n\n3. Anatomy: In anatomy, \"oblique\" is used to describe muscles that run at an angle to the axis of the body or to the fibers of another muscle, such as the external oblique muscles of the abdomen.\n\n4. Military: In a military context, an oblique order or oblique line is a formation in which the units are not parallel to the enemy's line.\n\n5. Literature and Speech: \"Oblique\" can also describe a way of indicating something indirectly or in a roundabout fashion, often to avoid confrontation or to be diplomatically subtle.\n\nThe word \"oblique\" has thus been used in English for centuries and has acquired various meanings across different domains, retaining its essence of something that is not straightforward, direct, or perpendicular. Its versatility in English reflects the adaptability and richness of the language, which has historically borrowed and incorporated terms from Latin and other languages.",

        "output": "When you're collaborating on a project using GitHub, merge conflicts can occur when multiple people make changes to the same part of the code. Here's a step-by-step guide for resolving GitHub merge conflicts:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Conflict\n- A merge conflict happens when Git can't automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.\n- Conflicts often occur when people work on the code at the same time.\n\n### Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes\nBefore you start resolving conflicts, make sure your local repository is up to date.\n```bash\ngit pull origin main\n```\n*Replace `main` with the name of the branch you're trying to merge.*\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Conflict\nGit will tell you that there is a merge conflict and in which files the conflict occurred.\n\n### Step 4: Open the Conflicted Files\nOpen the files with conflicts in your code editor to manually resolve the conflicts. Look for the conflict markers:\n```\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nyour changes\n=======\nsomeone else's changes\n>>>>>>> branch-name\n```\n\n### Step 5: Decide on the Changes\nDecide which changes to keep:\n- You can choose your changes, the other person's changes, or a combination of both.\n- Edit the file to remove the conflict markers and make the code work as intended.\n\n### Step 6: Save the File\nAfter you've made your decisions, save the file.\n\n### Step 7: Mark as Resolved\nUse the following command to mark the conflicts as resolved:\n```bash\ngit add <file-name>\n```\n\n### Step 8: Commit the Resolution\nCommit your changes to finalize the resolution:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Resolve merge conflicts\"\n```\nYou don't need to specify file names if you've already used `git add`.\n\n### Step 9: Push Your Changes\nPush your changes to the remote repository:\n```bash\ngit push origin main\n```\nAgain, replace `main` with the name of the branch you're working on.\n\n### Step 10: Verify the Merge\n- Check on GitHub to ensure that the merge conflict has been resolved and that the pull request can be merged automatically.\n\n### Tips for Resolving Conflicts\n- Communicate with your team. Often conflicts arise due to overlapping work. A quick discussion can help clarify which changes should be kept.\n- Use a merge tool. Some code editors and IDEs have built-in merge conflict tools that make it easier to visualize and resolve conflicts.\n- Practice good version control habits. Regularly pull and integrate changes to minimize conflicts.\n\nRemember, merge conflicts are a normal part of the collaborative development process. With practice, resolving them becomes a routine part of your workflow.",

Deploy the application to a production environment when the workflow is triggered by a push to the `main` branch.\n\nHere's the YAML for the workflow:\n\n```yaml\nname: Node.js CI/CD Workflow\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build-and-test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node-version: [14.x]\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n      with:\n        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n    - run: npm install\n    - run: npm run lint\n    - run: npm test\n    - run: npm run build\n\n  deploy:\n    needs: build-and-test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Set up Node.js\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n      with:\n        node-version: '14.x'\n    - run: npm install\n    - run: npm run build\n    - name: Deploy to production\n      run: echo \"Deploying to production\" # Replace this with actual deployment script\n      env:\n        DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nNote that in the `deploy` job, there's an `if` condition to ensure that it only runs on a push to the `main` branch. This is a simple example to showcase how you might set up a workflow to handle CI/CD tasks using GitHub Actions.\n\nYou'll need to replace the `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` commands with the actual commands used in your project. The deployment step is also a placeholder, and you would need to include your deployment script or action to push the built code to your hosting server or service. The `DEPLOY_TOKEN` is an example of how you might use a secret to authenticate with the deployment target.\n\nRemember that for real-world applications, you'll want to make sure your deployment mechanisms are secure and handle any necessary rollback procedures if the deployment fails.",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

        "instruction": "Write a short analysis of the cinematography in the movie.\n\nDead Poets Society",
        "output": "The cinematography of \"Dead Poets Society,\" directed by Peter Weir and shot by cinematographer John Seale, plays a pivotal role in conveying the film's themes and emotions. The film is known for its rich visual storytelling, which complements the narrative centered around an English teacher, John Keating, who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.\n\nHere is a brief analysis of the cinematography in \"Dead Poets Society\":\n\n**Lighting**: The film makes excellent use of natural and ambient lighting to set the tone and mood of the scenes. The use of warm lighting in the classroom scenes creates an inviting and inspirational atmosphere, which contrasts with the cooler, harsher lighting of the more traditional and oppressive parts of the Welton Academy. This contrast highlights the battle between conformity and individuality that is central to the film's theme.\n\n**Composition**: John Seale's composition often employs symmetry and depth to draw the viewer's attention to the characters and their environment. The framing often places characters within the rigid structures of the academy to visually represent the constraints placed upon them. In contrast, scenes featuring Keating or the students embracing his teachings often break free from this symmetry, using more dynamic and unbalanced compositions that reflect their newfound freedom and individuality.\n\n**Camera Movement**: The camera movements in \"Dead Poets Society\" are deliberate and serve to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes. Steadicam shots are used to follow characters, creating an intimate connection with the audience. Slow pans and tracking shots are often utilized to reveal the characters' environments, highlighting their place within the school and society.\n\n**Color Palette**: The film's color palette is generally muted, dominated by the earthy tones of the school's old stone buildings and the surrounding landscapes. This reinforces the traditional and historic nature of the setting, while also allowing moments of vibrancy—such as the autumnal outdoor scenes—to stand out, paralleling the moments of passion and creativity that the students experience.\n\n**Symbolic Use of Space**: The cinematography makes symbolic use of space, particularly in scenes where the boys are in open environments, such as their meetings in the cave or their outdoor activities. These scenes are shot with a sense of openness and freedom, contrasting with the confined and controlled spaces of the classrooms and dormitories.\n\n**Perspective and Point of View**: The film often takes the perspective of the students, with low-angle shots that look up at Keating, portraying him as an inspirational figure. Conversely, high-angle shots are sometimes used to depict the authority figures of the academy, making them appear more imposing and dominant.\n\n**Iconic Scenes**: There are several iconic scenes where the cinematography is particularly memorable. For instance, the \"O Captain! My Captain!\" scene uses a combination of low-angle shots and close-ups to capture the emotional climax of the film. The scene where the boys stand on their desks to show their solidarity with Keating is another example of powerful visual storytelling, conveying the theme of nonconformity and respect.\n\nOverall, the cinematography in \"Dead Poets Society\" is a vital component of the film's storytelling, enhancing the narrative and the emotional journey of the characters through thoughtful composition, lighting, and camera movement. It helps to create a visually rich film that resonates with viewers long after they have seen it.",

However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.\nIs == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?",
        "output": "In Java, comparing strings using the `==` operator and the `.equals()` method are two different operations, and understanding the difference is crucial for correct string comparison.\n\n- `==` Operator: This operator compares the references of two objects, not the actual content of the objects. When you use `==` with strings, you are actually comparing whether the two operands refer to the same object in memory. This means that unless two string references point to the same string object in the string pool, the `==` comparison will return `false`, even if the strings themselves contain the same characters.\n\n- `.equals()` Method: This method is defined in the `Object` class and is overridden in the `String` class to compare the values of two string objects. When you use `.equals()`, it checks whether the actual sequence of characters within the two strings is the same. This is what you usually want when comparing strings for equality.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the difference:\n\n```java\nString s1 = new String(\"hello\");\nString s2 = new String(\"hello\");\nString s3 = \"hello\";\nString s4 = \"hello\";\n\n// Reference comparison\nSystem.out.println(s1 == s2); // false, because s1 and s2 are two different objects in memory\nSystem.out.println(s3 == s4); // true, because s3 and s4 refer to the same object in the string pool\n\n// Value comparison\nSystem.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true, because s1 and s2 have the same characters\nSystem.out.println(s3.equals(s4)); // true, because s3 and s4 have the same characters\n```\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Use `==` when you want to compare if two string references point to the same object.\n- Use `.equals()` when you want to compare if two strings have the same value (i.e., the same sequence of characters).\n\nYou should almost always use `.equals()` when comparing strings unless you specifically need to compare object references. Using `==` can lead to bugs, as you've already experienced, because it does not compare the actual content of the strings.",

The `input()` function in Python does indeed hold the screen open for user input, but it doesn't satisfy the requirement of reading a single character without pressing enter. The `input()` function waits for the user to press enter before it returns the entire line of input as a string. Therefore, this answer is incorrect for the specific need described in the question. The question asks for a method similar to `getch()`, which reads a single character immediately after it is typed, without waiting for the enter key.",

You are also given an integer 'cooldown' which represents the cooldown period. After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock again until after the 'cooldown' days have passed. Your task is to design an algorithm to find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times), but you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\nExample:\nInput: prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2], cooldown = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by buying on day 1 (price = 1), selling on day 2 (price = 2), then buying on day 4 (price = 0), and selling on day 5 (price = 2). The cooldown period is observed after selling on day 2, so the next buying is on day 4.\nProfit = (2-1) + (2-0) = 3\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= prices.length <= 5000\n- 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000\n- 0 <= cooldown <= 10\n\nYour task is to implement a function `maxProfitWithCooldown` that takes an array of integers `prices` and an integer `cooldown` and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.\n\n```python\ndef maxProfitWithCooldown(prices: List[int], cooldown: int) -> int:\n    # Implement your solution here\n```\n\nNotes:\n1.

        "output": "To solve this problem without using loops or recursion, you can use the properties of logarithms or check whether the maximum power of 3 that fits in an integer divides `n` without a remainder. Here's a Java solution using the latter approach:\n\n```java\npublic class PowerOfThree {\n    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {\n        // The maximum value of n that is a power of 3 and fits within the 32-bit signed integer range is 3^19 = 1162261467\n        int maxPowerOfThree = 1162261467; // 3^19\n        // If n is a power of three, it must divide the maximum power of three without a remainder\n        return n > 0 && maxPowerOfThree % n == 0;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        PowerOfThree solution = new PowerOfThree();\n\n        // Test cases\n        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(27)); // Output: true\n        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(0));  // Output: false\n        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(-1)); // Output: false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis solution works under the assumption that if `n` is indeed a power of three, it must also be a factor of the largest power of three that fits in an `int`. This is because the powers of three form a sequence where each element is a multiple of the preceding one, so all smaller powers must be factors of the larger powers.\n\nThe number `1162261467` is used because it is the largest power of 3 that fits within the 32-bit signed integer range, which is `3^19`. To derive this, you would look for the highest exponent `x` such that `3^x` is less than or equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (`2^31 - 1`).

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

It highlights how mathematics is not only a scientific discipline but also possesses an intrinsic beauty that can be reflected in art. The relationship between the two fields dates back to ancient Greece, with sculptor Polykleitos using mathematical proportions for his works. Despite unsubstantiated claims regarding the golden ratio's use in ancient times, the Italian Renaissance saw a genuine application of mathematics in art. Luca Pacioli's treatise \"De divina proportione,\" with illustrations by Leonardo da Vinci, and Piero della Francesca's exploration of Euclidean perspective in art, exemplify this integration. Albrecht Dürer also incorporated mathematical concepts in his artwork. In the 20th century, artists like M. C. Escher utilized mathematical principles such as tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, often with guidance from mathematicians like H. S. M. Coxeter. The De Stijl movement, with figures such as Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian, openly adopted geometric forms.

Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.",
        "output": "The fair trade movement is an international initiative aimed at creating more equitable and sustainable trading practices that support the rights of marginalized producers and workers, particularly in developing countries. The movement champions the payment of fair prices as well as social and environmental standards in the production and trade of a wide range of commodities such as coffee, chocolate, sugar, tea, bananas, honey, cotton, wine, fruit, chocolate, flowers, and handicrafts.\n\nFair trade's core objective is to combat the exploitation that can occur within conventional trade, where the producers often receive a minimal fraction of the final product's price, by ensuring they receive a fair share of the economic benefits. This is facilitated through mechanisms like the fair trade minimum price, which acts as a safety net against the volatile market prices, and an additional premium that producers can invest in business or community projects.\n\nThe movement also focuses on sustainable environmental practices. Fair trade-certified producers must adhere to a set of environmental standards that minimize the use of harmful agrochemicals, restrict the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and promote biodiversity and energy efficiency.\n\nIn addition to economic and environmental standards, fair trade also emphasizes social criteria, which include ensuring safe working conditions, prohibiting child and forced labor, and promoting workers' rights and the right to organize.\n\nThe fair trade movement has stimulated a discussion about the concept of trade as a human right. This discourse suggests that everyone should have the right to trade under conditions that uphold their dignity, allowing them to live a decent life. It challenges the traditional view of trade merely as an economic transaction, instead proposing that trade policies and practices should be aligned with human rights principles.\n\nThere are several organizations that certify products as fair trade, including Fairtrade International (FLO) and its U.S. affiliate Fair Trade USA. These organizations have their own distinct certification marks, which consumers can look for when shopping to ensure that the products they purchase meet fair trade standards.\n\nThe impact of fair trade is multifaceted. It has proven to improve livelihoods and communities in the global South and has influenced the way consumers in the global North think about the origins and production conditions of the goods they buy. However, critics argue that fair trade can be more of a niche market than a solution to systemic trade inequities. They also point out that fair trade certification can be costly for producers, potentially excluding the smallest and most disadvantaged producers from participating.\n\nUltimately, the fair trade movement advocates for a shift in trade policies and business practices to be more inclusive, sustainable, and ethically grounded. It provides a practical framework for consumers to make a positive difference through their purchasing choices, and it continues to evolve in response to the challenges of global trade and the needs of producers and workers around the world.",

Be sure to deburr and smooth any sharp edges for safety.\n\n#### Step 2: Drill Inlet and Outlet Holes\n1. Drill two small holes on opposite sides of the beer can near the bottom edge. These will serve as the inlet and outlet for the steam.\n2. Ensure the holes are slightly smaller than the outer diameter of your copper tubing.\n\n#### Step 3: Create the Boiler\n1. Coil the copper tubing to create a small boiler. Leave two ends sticking out – one for the inlet, which will be connected to the water source (syringe), and one for the outlet, which will release the steam.\n2. Connect one end of the copper tubing to one of the holes in the beer can using epoxy glue or a hot glue gun. Make sure the seal is airtight.\n3. Connect the other end of the tubing to the opposite hole in the beer can, ensuring it's also airtight.\n\n#### Step 4: Attach the Syringe\n1. Cut the end off the plastic syringe to allow it to fit onto the copper tubing inlet.\n2. Securely attach the syringe to the inlet tubing using glue or rubber tubing. This syringe will act as a water reservoir and pump to push water into the boiler.\n\n#### Step 5: Construct the Crankshaft\n1. Bend a piece of wire or a paperclip into a crankshaft shape. Ensure it has a crank arm that can be connected to the copper tubing outlet.\n2. Mount the crankshaft to the wooden base so that it can freely rotate.\n\n#### Step 6: Connect the Outlet to the Crankshaft\n1. Make a small paddle or turbine that can be pushed by the steam coming out of the outlet tubing.\n2. Connect this paddle to the crank arm of the crankshaft so that when steam is released, it causes the crankshaft to rotate.\n\n#### Step 7: Assemble the Engine\n1. Mount the beer can boiler onto the wooden base securely.\n2. Ensure the outlet tubing is properly aligned with the crankshaft paddle.\n\n#### Step 8: Test Your Steam Engine\n1. Fill the syringe with water.\n2. Light the candle and place it under the beer can boiler to heat the water in the copper tubing.\n3. As the water heats up, it will turn into steam and start to exit through the outlet tubing.\n4. The steam will then hit the paddle connected to the crankshaft, causing it to rotate.\n\n### Safety Precautions:\n- Always wear safety gear, including gloves and goggles.\n- Be mindful of the sharp edges on the can and use tools carefully to avoid cuts.\n- Be cautious with the heat source to prevent burns and fire hazards.\n- Never seal the boiler completely; steam pressure can build up and cause an explosion.\n- Ensure the room is well-ventilated to avoid inhalation of any fumes.\n\nBuilding a steam engine from an empty beer can is a hands-on way to understand steam power and basic engineering. Remember to proceed with caution and enjoy the learning experience!",

        "output": "To estimate the cost of supplies required for a DIY Water Chiller, we'll need to look at average prices for each component. Please keep in mind that prices can vary significantly based on brand, quality, capacity, and the retailer. The following are rough estimates based on US prices:\n\n1. Ice-maker: Depending on the type (portable or built-in) and capacity, a small portable ice maker could cost anywhere from $100 to $250.\n\n2. Icebox/cooler: A mid-range cooler with good insulation might range from $20 to $100, depending on size and brand.\n\n3. Temperature regulator: A basic temperature controller for DIY projects might cost between $20 and $50.\n\n4. Aquarium pump: Each pump could cost between $10 and $40, depending on the flow rate and brand. Since you need two, you would double this cost.\n\n5. 12V power supply: A reliable 12V power supply could cost between $10 and $30.\n\nLet's calculate an estimated total cost using average values from these ranges:\n\n1. Ice-maker: $175 (average of $100 to $250)\n2. Icebox/cooler: $60 (average of $20 to $100)\n3. Temperature regulator: $35 (average of $20 to $50)\n4. Aquarium pump x2: $50 ($25 each as an average of $10 to $40)\n5. 12V power supply: $20 (average of $10 to $30)\n\nNow, we'll sum these up to get the total estimated cost:\n\nTotal cost = Ice-maker + Icebox/cooler + Temperature regulator + Aquarium pumps + 12V power supply\nTotal cost = $175 + $60 + $35 + $50 + $20\nTotal cost = $340\n\nSo, the estimated total cost for the supplies to create a DIY Water Chiller is approximately $340. Remember that this is a rough estimate, and actual costs may vary. Additionally, taxes, shipping fees, or any additional materials or tools needed for assembly are not included in this estimate.",

Scott Fitzgerald's novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" which is commonly studied in high school literature classes.\n\nAt the end of \"The Great Gatsby,\" the green light at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the water from Jay Gatsby's mansion symbolizes multiple themes, including hope, desire, and the American Dream. Throughout the novel, the green light represents Gatsby's unattainable dream to reunite with Daisy and recapture their past love.\n\nGatsby's yearning for Daisy is closely tied to his pursuit of wealth and social status, which he believes are necessary to win her back. The green light, therefore, also embodies the larger theme of the elusive nature of the American Dream and the idea that the pursuit of material success may not necessarily lead to happiness or fulfillment.\n\nIn the larger context of the novel, the green light can be seen as a metaphor for the characters' constant reaching towards something just out of reach, reflecting the human condition of perpetual desire and the inherent dissatisfaction that comes with it.",

        "output": "**Mental Exercise: The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**\n\n**Objective:** To manage anxiety by grounding oneself in the present moment, engaging multiple senses to shift focus away from anxious thoughts.\n\n**How It Works:** Anxiety often involves worrying about the future or ruminating on the past. The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique brings attention back to the present by systematically going through the senses and listing things you notice around you. This mindfulness-based exercise helps break the cycle of anxious thoughts by redirecting your focus to the here and now, which is typically free from the stressors that trigger anxiety.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **5 - Sights:** Begin by taking a deep breath. Look around your current environment and silently name five things you can see. Choose items with different characteristics, such as color, texture, or function. For example, you might see a green plant with shiny leaves, a soft, red chair, a bright painting on the wall, a wooden bookshelf filled with books, and a blue mug on a desk.\n\n2. **4 - Touches:** Notice and name four things you can physically feel. This could include the sensation of clothing on your skin, the texture of the chair you're sitting in, the feeling of a breeze on your face, or the smooth surface of a table you're resting your hands on.\n\n3. **3 - Sounds:** Listen carefully and identify three sounds within your environment. The noises might be the ticking of a clock, distant traffic, birds chirping outside, or the low hum of a computer or appliance.\n\n4. **2 - Smells:** Acknowledge two things you can smell. If you can’t immediately smell anything, try to imagine the scent of familiar objects like a cup of coffee, a lemon slice, or the pages of a new book.\n\n5. **1 - Taste:** Focus on one thing you can taste. This might be the lingering taste of a meal or drink, or simply the freshness of your own breath. If you can’t taste anything, recall the flavor of a favorite food or drink.\n\n6. **Finish with a Deep Breath:** Take another deep breath to conclude the exercise. Feel your lungs expand with the inhalation and contract with the exhalation.\n\n**Why It Helps:** This exercise leverages mindfulness principles, compelling individuals to engage with their immediate sensory experiences rather than getting lost in anxious thoughts. By systematically going through the senses, the brain is occupied with the task at hand, which can interrupt the automatic cycle of anxiety. This technique also has the advantage of being simple and discreet, making it a convenient tool to use almost anywhere, whether at home, work, or in public spaces.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n- Practice the exercise regularly, even when not feeling anxious, to become more familiar with it.\n- If you find one sense particularly calming, you can spend more time focusing on that sense.\n- Pair the exercise with slow, deep breathing to enhance relaxation.\n- If anxiety persists or worsens, consider seeking help from a professional therapist or counselor.",

Here are some general guidelines on how verb endings are applied in German:\n\n1. **Regular Verbs in Present Tense**:\n   - For most regular verbs, you drop the infinitive ending \"-en\" and add the following endings:\n     - ich (I) -e: ich spiele (I play)\n     - du (you singular informal) -st: du spielst (you play)\n     - er/sie/es (he/she/it) -t: er spielt (he plays)\n     - wir (we) -en: wir spielen (we play)\n     - ihr (you plural informal) -t: ihr spielt (you play)\n     - sie/Sie (they/you formal) -en: sie spielen (they play); Sie spielen (you play)\n\n2. **Regular Verbs in Simple Past Tense (Präteritum)**:\n   - For regular verbs, you typically add the following endings to the stem (after removing the \"-en\" from the infinitive):\n     - ich -te: ich spielte (I played)\n     - du -test: du spieltest (you played)\n     - er/sie/es -te: er spielte (he played)\n     - wir -ten: wir spielten (we played)\n     - ihr -tet: ihr spieltet (you played)\n     - sie/Sie -ten: sie spielten (they played); Sie spielten (you played)\n\n3. **Irregular Verbs**:\n   - Irregular verbs can have various stem changes in different tenses and moods. For instance, in the present tense, the verb \"sehen\" (to see) changes its stem for the second (du) and third (er/sie/es) person singular:\n     - ich sehe\n     - du siehst\n     - er/sie/es sieht\n   - In the simple past, irregular verbs often change their stem and may have different endings:\n     - ich sah (I saw)\n     - du sahst (you saw)\n     - er/sie/es sah (he/she/it saw)\n     - wir sahen (we saw)\n     - ihr saht (you saw)\n     - sie/Sie sahen (they/you saw)\n\n4. **Imperative Mood**:\n   - For giving commands, there are different forms for the singular \"du,\" the plural \"ihr,\" and the formal \"Sie\":\n     - du: Spiel! (Play!)\n     - ihr: Spielt! (Play!)\n     - Sie: Spielen Sie! (Play!)\n\n5. **Subjunctive Mood (Konjunktiv)**:\n   - This mood is used for indirect speech, polite requests, and hypotheticals. It has its own set of endings, often based on the simple past tense stem:\n     - Konjunktiv I: ich spiele, du spielest, er/sie/es spiele...\n     - Konjunktiv II: ich spielte, du spieltest, er/sie/es spielte...\n\nRemember that these are just basic guidelines, and there are many exceptions and additional rules, especially with irregular verbs and verbs with separable or inseparable prefixes. Also, compound tenses like the present perfect (Perfekt) or past perfect (Plusquamperfekt) involve using auxiliary verbs \"haben\" (to have) or \"sein\" (to be) along with the past participle of the main verb.",

        "output": "To enhance the flavor of popcorn, try this cooking hack:\n\n**Use clarified butter (ghee):** Instead of using regular butter, drizzle your popcorn with clarified butter. Clarified butter has had the water and milk solids removed, so it's pure butterfat. This means it has a richer, more intense flavor and won't make your popcorn soggy like regular butter can. It also has a higher smoke point, so you can heat it up without burning it.\n\nHere's how to make clarified butter at home:\n\n1. Melt unsalted butter in a saucepan over low heat. Allow it to simmer gently.\n2. The butter will separate into three layers - foam on top, clear golden liquid in the middle, and milk solids at the bottom.\n3. Skim off the foam with a spoon and discard it.\n4. Carefully pour the clear golden liquid into a heatproof container, leaving behind the milk solids in the pan.\n5. Drizzle the warm clarified butter over your popcorn and toss to coat evenly.\n\nTo further boost the flavor:\n\n- Add a sprinkle of fine sea salt or flavored salts such as truffle salt, smoked salt, or herb-infused salt.\n- Toss the popcorn with nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor without the cheese.\n- Experiment with spices like chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, or curry powder for a savory kick.\n- For a sweet twist, sprinkle on cinnamon sugar immediately after coating the popcorn with butter so it sticks.\n- If you like a bit of spice, try adding a few drops of hot sauce to the clarified butter before drizzling it over the popcorn.\n\nEnjoy your deliciously flavored popcorn!",

        "output": "To prepare chewy chocolate chip cookies, you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature\n- 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n- 1 cup packed brown sugar\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n- 2 large eggs\n- 2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips\n\nFollow these steps to make your cookies:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\n\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.\n\n3. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the room temperature butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\n4. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the ingredients are well incorporated.\n\n5. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients, mixing just until the flour is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as that can lead to tougher cookies.\n\n6. Fold in the chocolate chips with a spatula or wooden spoon until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.\n\n7. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop heaping tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie for them to spread (about 2 inches).\n\n8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned but the centers are still soft. The baking time will affect the chewiness, so if you prefer them extra chewy, lean towards the lower end of the baking time range.\n\n9. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them sit on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n10. Repeat with the remaining dough, baking in batches if necessary.\n\nEnjoy your chewy chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage! Remember, the key to chewiness is not overbaking them; they will firm up as they cool.",
