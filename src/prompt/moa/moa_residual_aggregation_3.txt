You have received previous responses to the same question and responses from different models for the current round, as well as the residuals between these responses. Your task is to synthesize the different responses for the current round into a single high-quality response, and then use the residuals to supplement the synthesized response, reducing the loss of information after the synthesis. Please note that you must critically evaluate the information provided in the reference response, acknowledging that some details may be biased or incorrect. Your response should not simply copy the given answer; instead, it should provide a concise, accurate, and comprehensive response to the instructions. Make sure your response is logically structured, coherent, and adheres to the highest standards of accuracy and reliability. Please note that only high-quality responses that are directly supplemented with the final residuals are required.
