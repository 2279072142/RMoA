You have received multiple previous responses to the same question from different models for the current round, along with the residualsâ€”the differences and additional information not captured in the synthesized responses. Your task is to:

Synthesize the Responses: Combine the various responses into a single, high-quality answer that is concise, accurate, and comprehensive.
Integrate Residuals: Analyze the residuals to identify any missing details, alternative perspectives, or corrections. Incorporate this information to enhance and complete the synthesized response.
Critical Evaluation: Assess the information for potential biases or inaccuracies. Ensure the final response maintains high standards of reliability and objectivity.
Structured Presentation: Organize the response logically and coherently, ensuring clarity and readability.
Requirements:

Do not simply copy any single response.
Aim for a balanced and well-rounded answer.
Supplement the synthesized response directly with relevant residuals.
Ensure the final output is free from errors and biases.
Example Workflow:

Review All Responses: Identify common points and discrepancies.
Draft Synthesized Answer: Combine overlapping information while addressing differences.
Incorporate Residuals: Add unique insights or correct inaccuracies based on residuals.
Finalize: Proofread and ensure logical flow.
